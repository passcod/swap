# swp (wip)

_Swap two paths, atomically or as close as._

This tool uses (in order of preference):

 - [x] the [`renameat2`] syscall on Linux 3.15+; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`renamex_np`] function on macOS and APFS; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`exchangedata`] syscall on macOS; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`renameat2`] syscall on [WSL2], assuming it supports that when released; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`MoveFileTransacted`] function on Windows systems that support [Transactional NTFS]; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] as first fallback, for small files, memory-mapping both files and swapping their contents;
 - [ ] as second fallback, hardlinks and renaming;
 - [ ] as third fallback, renames only.

## Install

From source:

```
cargo install swp
```

Or use [a prebuilt release](https://github.com/passcod/swp/releases).

## Usage

```
$ swp filea fileb
```

With `-v`, it prints out the swapped paths on success:

```
$ swp -v filea fileb
filea <-> fileb
```

The tool is also a library:

```rust
let a = PathBuf::from("filea");
let b = PathBuf::from("fileb");

swp::swap_paths(&a, &b)?;
```

And you can select one or more strategies if you don't want the default behaviour:

```rust
swp::swap_paths_custom(&a, &b, &[
    swp::Strategy::RenameAt2,
    swp::Strategy::ExchangeData,
    swp::Strategy::TwoRenames,
])?;
```
