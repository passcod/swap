# swp (wip)

_Swap two paths, atomically or as close as._

This tool uses:

 - [x] the [`renameat2`] syscall on Linux 3.15+; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`renamex_np`] on macOS and APFS; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`exchangedata`] syscall on macOS; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`MoveFileTransacted`] syscall on Windows systems that support [Transactional NTFS]; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] the [`renameat2`] syscall on [WSL2], assuming it supports that when released; (**atomic**)
 - [ ] as first fallback, for small files, memory-mapping both files and swapping their contents;
 - [ ] as second fallback, hardlinks and renaming;
 - [ ] as third fallback, renames only.
